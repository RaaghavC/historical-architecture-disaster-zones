# PROJECT VISION: Historical Architecture in Disaster Zones
## Digital Documentation, Archiving, and Preservation (Antakya Case Study)

---

## Executive Summary

This project addresses the urgent need to digitally document and preserve the architectural heritage of Antakya (ancient Antioch) following the catastrophic February 6, 2023 earthquakes in Turkey. The project is funded by a Humanities Seed Grant from Stanford Public Humanities and represents a three-year international collaborative effort to:

1. **Document** historical monuments affected by the earthquakes through comprehensive data collection
2. **Archive** this data in a robust digital infrastructure accessible to researchers and the public
3. **Reconstruct** damaged structures using AI-assisted 3D modeling techniques
4. **Share** the results through public access portals, educational materials, and community engagement

## Introduction and Background

### The Crisis

Antakya (ancient Antioch-on-the-Orontes) in southern Turkey suffered catastrophic damage in the February 6, 2023 earthquakes:
- **3,752 of 8,444** registered historical structures in Hatay Province were damaged
- Over **$2 billion** estimated for restoration needs
- The historic core of the city was left in near-total ruin
- Monuments spanning Roman, Christian, and Islamic heritage were destroyed

### Notable Losses

- **Habib-i Neccar Mosque**: Among Anatolia's oldest mosques, collapsed losing its historic domed roof and 17th-century minaret
- **Greek Orthodox Church**: Once the Patriarchal seat, facade reduced to rubble
- **4th-century Church of St. Pierre**: Badly damaged
- **Historical Synagogue**: Severely impacted
- **Historic Market Area**: Extensive damage
- **Hatay Archaeological Museum**: Scheduled to reopen in 2025

### Historical Significance

Founded by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, Antakya has been continuously settled for over 2,300 years. The city embodies layers of history:
- Roman fortifications and infrastructure
- Byzantine churches and mosaics
- Early Islamic architecture
- Ottoman mosques and commercial buildings
- Multi-faith heritage sites (churches, mosques, synagogues)

### The Urgency

As noted by heritage experts: *"The recovery of cultural heritage is not just about rebuilding monuments; it's about preserving the soul of a region – the essence of its identity."* The remnants continue to deteriorate from:
- Exposure to elements
- Ongoing aftershocks
- Lack of stabilization
- Risk of looting or neglect

## Four-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Data Collection and Documentation

**Timeline**: Immediate start (highest urgency)

**Objectives**:
- Field survey and damage assessment using high-resolution photography, drone imagery, and 3D laser scanning
- Archival research to collect historical visual records (19th-20th century photographs, plans, maps)
- Recording oral histories from residents, historians, and community elders
- Salvage existing documentation from local institutions

**Methods**:
- LiDAR scanning and drone-based photogrammetry
- 360° panoramic photography
- Archival research in global institutions
- Social media appeals for historical photos
- Sensitive community interviews

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive digital catalog with metadata
- Damage assessment report with before/after comparisons
- Interview transcripts and recordings
- Raw data repository with secure backups

### Phase 2: Digital Archival Design and Infrastructure

**Timeline**: Parallel with Phase 1, continuing through project

**Objectives**:
- Develop structured database with rich metadata schemas
- Create web-based digital archive portal with geospatial visualization
- Implement data integration and redundant backup systems
- Plan for long-term digital preservation

**Methods**:
- Implementation of standard heritage metadata schemas (Dublin Core, Arches)
- Open-source platform evaluation and deployment
- GIS integration for spatial data
- IIIF compliance for image interoperability

**Deliverables**:
- Functional digital archive/database with web interface
- Integrated data visualization tools (maps, timelines, 3D viewers)
- Archival Design Report documenting schema and preservation strategy
- Backup and preservation plan with institutional partnerships

### Phase 3: AI-Assisted Reconstruction and 3D Model Development

**Timeline**: Mid-project, most time-intensive phase

**Objectives**:
- Create detailed 3D models of monuments in pre-earthquake state
- Leverage AI for gap-filling and detail enhancement
- Reconstruct historical landscapes and urban contexts
- Establish expert verification processes

**Methods**:
- Photogrammetry software (Metashape, RealityCapture)
- AI/ML techniques including:
  - Neural networks for architectural pattern learning
  - Diffusion models for detail restoration
  - NeRF for sparse view reconstruction
- Expert validation and community feedback loops

**Deliverables**:
- High-fidelity 3D models of 3-5 priority monuments
- Before-and-after visualizations
- Technical report on AI reconstruction methods
- VR/AR prototypes for public engagement

### Phase 4: Public Access, Education, and Outreach

**Timeline**: Final phase, continuing beyond initial project

**Objectives**:
- Transform archive into public-facing digital museum
- Develop educational materials and programming
- Engage community in validation and enrichment
- Organize exhibitions and stakeholder outreach

**Methods**:
- Web development for public portal (bilingual Turkish/English)
- Partnership with educators for curriculum development
- Community workshops and crowdsourcing initiatives
- Integration with international heritage platforms

**Deliverables**:
- Publicly accessible digital archive website
- Educational content package (videos, curricula, interactive maps)
- Documentation of community engagement events
- Sustainability and handover plan
